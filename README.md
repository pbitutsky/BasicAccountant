# BasicAccountant

My accounting (UGBA 102A) homework was taking too long. I got tired of posting to T-account ledgers, making journal entries, adjusting entries, finding unadjusted trial balances, etc... And accountants have software to do that stuff for them anyway.
So I made this software to streamline my homework.
